Trigger script which continuously scans a waveform directory and processes new files using the workflow:

1. New waveform files imported into an obspy stream, detrended and bandpass filtered (utils.data_in).
2. A plot of the data is created and displayed.
3. A coincidence function is applied to the stream (trigger.iscoincidence).
4. If events are identified, data are sliced into 5 second parts with P- and S-wave picks added.
5. These are saved as .sac files and .png images.
6. The .sac files are opened in SAC to allow the waveforms to be more accurately picked.
7. User asked if they want a .obs exported. If yes, dir moved to 'Local' dir, if no, dir moved to 'Noise' dir.
8. If .obs file requested, file exported.

Requires SAC to be install. (https://members.elsi.jp/~george/sac-download.html)
